## GitHub Actions and Build Process

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). The CI/CD pipeline is configured to build the project automatically on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.

The pipeline includes the following steps:
1. Check out the repository
2. Set up the environment
3. Run the build process

The GitHub Actions configuration file can be found in the `.github/workflows` directory.
